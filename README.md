# NBA-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to use past data from the nba to see how different teams compete against there spread. A spread is a term mostly used in sports gambling that represents how much the team will win by. A spread is determined by how the team has been doing throughout the season and who they are playing against. 

This project is supposed to help predict whether or not the person who is trying to guess if the team will "cover" will actually cover.
