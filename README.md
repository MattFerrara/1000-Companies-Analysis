# NBA-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to use past data from the nba to see how different teams compete against there spread. A spread is a term mostly used in sports gambling that represents how much the team will win by. A spread is determined by how the team has been doing throughout the season and who they are playing against. Spreads found on sports books are determined by a sports betting algorithm.

This project is supposed to help predict whether or not the person who is trying to guess if the team will "cover" will actually cover. 

## Selection of Data
The data set has over 6,000 games containing five seperate categories: The teams name, the date which the game was played, who they played, the score of the game and if they won or lost, the spread and if they covered or not, and the over under.

The dataset was put together by myself. I found the informaton on covers.com[1] to get the data i used a webscraping algorithm shown below.
